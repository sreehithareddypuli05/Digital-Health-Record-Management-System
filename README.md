Digital Health Record Management System for Migrant workers in Kerala

Why we took this problem

Migrant workers, the silent force behind India’s progress.
In our research on migrant workers in Kerala, we found that their health problems are
extensive and not adequately addressed. To tackle this issue, we propose a solution that
leverages technology to improve their healthcare outcomes.

Advantages:-

●​ Continuity of Care – Health records stay with the worker wherever they move,ensuring
uninterrupted treatment
●​ Faster & Better Medical Services – Doctors can instantly see medical history, test
reports → reduces delays in diagnosis and treatment
●​ Cost Savings – Paperwork and unnecessary medicines→ lowers healthcare expenses
for workers
●​ Portable & Worker-Centered – Migrant workers carry their digital record like a health
identity, usable across hospitals,states, and employers.
●​ Data for Public Health Planning – Authorities can track disease patterns,vaccination
coverage, and workplace health risks → helps in targeted interventions
●​ Reduced duplication of diagnostics:- It minimizes unnecessary repetition of diagnostic
tests, which not only reduces healthcare costs but also improves timely access to
treatment

Uniqueness of our Idea:-

Our project focuses on improving hospital management and patient care. It uses QR code
technology to quickly access patient records and track visits. A language translation feature
ensures clear communication between patients and medical staff. Online OP registration allows
patients to book appointments easily from anywhere. These innovations make healthcare faster,
more efficient, and patient-friendly.
